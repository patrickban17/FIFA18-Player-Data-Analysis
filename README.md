# FIFA18-Player-Data-Analysis
As a FIFA18 player myself, I wanted to take this opportunity to create a dashboard that I could use on a regular basis in order to analyze each individual player. There is a game mode in FIFA18 that allows the users to act as club managers, assigned with various tasks such as buying or scouting players. Each view in this dashboard allows the manager to search players around the world and analyze their unique skill-sets.
